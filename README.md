I'm a Frontend Engineer and [Technical Writer](https://dev.to/easybuoy) based in Lagos, Nigeria. I'm passionate about web technologies and making the web accessible to everyone.

When not working on a project or thinking about programming, I'm most likely watching TV series on Netflix, playing tennis, sight-seeing, watching Manchester City play football, or spending time with family and friends.

**I am currently looking for a software engineer position with an exciting company.**
